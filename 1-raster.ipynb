    "## 1. Background\n",
    "\n",
    "[GDAL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDAL) is a powerful and mature library for reading, writing and warping raster datasets, written in C++ with bindings to other languages. There are a variety of geospatial libraries available on the python package index, and almost all of them depend\n",
    "on GDAL.  One such python library developed and supported by Mapbox, ``rasterio``, builds on top of GDAL's many features, but provides a more pythonic interface and supports many of the features and formats that GDAL supports. Both GDAL and rasterio are constantly being updated and improved: As of writing this tutorial (July 2018), GDAL is at version 2.3.1 and rasterio is at version 1.0.2.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When should you use GDAL directly?**\n",
    "* If you are comfortable with the terminal, [GDAL's command line utilities](https://www.gdal.org/gdal_utilities.html) are very useful for scripting.\n",
    "* Note that GDAL also has auto-generated [Python bindings](https://pypi.org/project/GDAL/), but we recommend using rasterio instead!\n",
    "\n",
    "**When should you use ``rasterio`` instead of GDAL?**\n",
    "* Maybe always?! Rasterio also has a set of command line tools \n",
    "* If you are working in a Python environment (ipython, scripts, jupyter lab)\n",
    "\n",
    "**When might these not be the best tools?**\n",
    "* Both libraries are critical for input/output operations, but you'll draw on other libraries for computation (e.g. numpy)\n",
    "    * That said, GDAL does have some standard processing scripts (for example [pan-sharpening](https://www.gdal.org/gdal_pansharpen.html)) and rasterio provides a [plugin interface](https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio/wiki/Rio-plugin-registry) for workflows\n",
    "* For polished map creation and interactive visualization, a desktop GIS software like [QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/) may be a better, more fully-featured choice.\n"

    "The Landsat program is the longest-running civilian satellite imagery program, with the first satellite launched in 1972 by the US Geological Survey. Landsat 8 is the latest satellite in this program, and was launched in 2013. Landsat observations are processed into “scenes”, each of which is approximately 183 km x 170 km, with a spatial resolution of 30 meters and a temporal resolution of 16 days. The duration of the landsat program makes it an attractive source of medium-scale imagery for land surface change analyses. Landsat is multiband imagery, you can read more about it [here](https://landsat.usgs.gov).\n",
    "\n",
    "One reason we'll use Landsat 8 for this demo is that the entire Landsat 8 archive is hosted by various commercial Cloud providers with free public access ([AWS](https://registry.opendata.aws/landsat-8/) and [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/public-datasets/landsat))! \n",

    "A single Landsat8 scene is about 1 Gb in size since it contains a large array of data for each imagery band. Images are often grouped into a single .tar.gz file, which requires scientists to download the entire 1 Gb, even if you are just interested in a single band or subset of the image. To circumvent downloading, a new format has been proposed for Cloud storage called [Cloud-optimized Geotiffs (COGs)](http://www.cogeo.org), to allow easy access to individual bands or even subsets of single images. \n",

    "In a strict sense, the Landsat images on AWS and Google Cloud are not COGs (you can validate the format with online tools such as this - http://cog-validate.radiant.earth/html). Nevertheless, the files are stored as tiled Geotiffs, so many COG features still work.\n",

In fact the Google Cloud storage archive is a complete mirror of the full USGS archive, whereas as of writing this, AWS only has collection 1 scenes after 2017. In general, performance will be best if you are accessing data locally (so if you are running this notebook on AWS, use the landsat public data on AWS)! We are going to use the AWS archive for the rest of this tutorial because of the convenience of overviews:"

If you went to the [AWS Landsat Archive page](https://registry.opendata.aws/landsat-8), you probably noticed that it isn't obvious how to search and discover images (most of the time you probably won't know the row, path, or full URL of images over your area of interest!) There are many options for searching, graphical web applications like [NASA's Earthdata Search](https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov), or convenient Python tools like DevSeed's [sat-search](https://github.com/sat-utils/sat-search), among many others! We won't go into these tools here, but we encourage you to experiment with your own image scenes.

    "Rasterio can also be used for masking, reprojecting, and regridding distinct datasets. Here is one simple example to reproject our local NDVI onto a WGS84 Lat/Lon Grid. The example creates a 'VRT' file, which is merely a ASCII text file describing the transformation and other image metadata. The array values do no need to be duplicated, the VRT file just contains a reference to the local file (LC08_L1TP_042034_20170616_20170629_01_T1_NDVI_OVIEW.tif).
