# geohack2018-raster-update
incorporating rasterio into previous geohackweek tutorial


## changes to 2017 content:
    - use rasterio instead of gdal bindings and pygeoprocessing/pygeotools for basic tutorial
    - move advanced content to advanced break-out sessions later in the week
    - read from public cloud datasets rather than pre-cropped local subsets


## New environment (assuming conda 4.5.4)
conda env create raster.yml
conda activate raster
